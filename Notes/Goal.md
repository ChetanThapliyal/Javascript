# Goal
- implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables
- use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript
- construct functions and pass data through them
- identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript
- use arrays to store lists of data
- use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times
- use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays
- use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items

## Why learning?
- Cloud Resume Challenge needs to build a Visitor Counter for website which will be stored in Cosmos DB.

## Estimated Time
log time - 28-June-25 1:48PM IST
- As of now I don't want to be expert so spending 6-8 hours should suffice.
